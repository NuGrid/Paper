## Observational plot

* add a mixing line adding just $^{12}C$ 

## Equilibrium runs

* dependence on H abundance 
* make sure you put enough resolution at the start 

## CN-burn runs

1. Set initial abundances for CN runs. These represent H burning in the shell/envelope without CSI (but could include some secular mixing process), @OC best guestimate for that? Model for hydro, envelope: X(N14) = 1e-8, from 45Msun model from Ondrea's letter that served as input for the hydro Pop III sims.
2. Show how equilibrium abundance depends on temperature (and on H abundance) in C/N-C12/13 diagram. (plot 1)

## H-ingestion runs

We may rather call these H-CSI runs. CSI = Convective Shell interaction.

1. Initial abundance is such that we add C12 to the CN-burn equilibrium run (output) so that we  (compare both cases for just two T, plot 2) 
   1. get to something that we would observe in a CEMP-no star a typical CEMP-no star has [C/H] -2, so that would be 3e-2/1e2=3e-4 , or
   2. something like we have in the He shell (6% C12 by mass, OC confirm, point to something)

## Observations

* OC find more data? What about CEMP-i stars
